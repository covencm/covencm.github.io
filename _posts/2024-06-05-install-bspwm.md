## What is bspwm

 BSPWM is a tiling window manager that arranges windows in a non-overlapping pattern. It is very easy to configure. but bspwm doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs a third party program (e.g. sxhkd) is needed in order to translate keyboard and pointer events to bspc invocations.

> `sudo apt install bspwm sxhkd polybar alacritty picom`
